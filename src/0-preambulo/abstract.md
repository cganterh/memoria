The SCALE-UP ("Student-Centered Active Learning Environment
with Upside-down Pedagogies") classrooms are designed to
provide an environment for active and collaborative
learning. These teaching techniques rely heavily on the
interaction between students with different understanding
about the same concept. Achieving this in courses with a
high number of students is a challenge and therefore
technology support is needed.

In this work an ICT platform will de developed to be used in
SCALE-UP classrooms. The platform will provide a working
environment for the classroom’s activities. By monitoring
the responses of students the platform will identify
students with different answers. This will encourage
discussion among students. The design will require the
application to communicate bidirectionally with the clients
(mobile devices), identify students, obtain student’s
position in the classroom and provide a working environment
for a wide number of different
activities.
